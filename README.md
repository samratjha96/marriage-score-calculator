# Marriage Card Game Score Calculator
My family loves playing the [Marriage Card Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_(card_game)) but we hate having to keep track of the weird scoring system and determining who won at the end of the game

My philosophy is that I will do anything computation in nature manually. But only once. The second time I need a program. Here's the program to handle that and let us focus on purely playing the game and leave the scoring to the dumb machine


# TODOS
- Add cobra as cli tool. Support -f for input file and -o for output file. Make score a subcommand that takes in it's own -f flag
- Figure out where to put all the consts
- Logic to determine only one winner still doesn't work
- More tests
